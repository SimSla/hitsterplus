# Hitster Plus

Alternative app for the Hitster card game. Plays random ~30s snippets without showing the artist/track name.

### Caveats

- Intended for personal use -- the Spotify API is called with dev credentials, so will only allow whitelisted users.
- My first experiment with React, so probably not very idiomatic.
